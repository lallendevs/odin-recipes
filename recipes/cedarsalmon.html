    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cedar-planked salmon is one of those dishes that feels rustic and refined at the same time. The slow-roasting method is simple, but it creates an unforgettable depth of flavor. By soaking the planks and setting them over steady heat, the wood begins to smolder gently, releasing its natural oils and smoky aroma. As the salmon cooks, it absorbs that character, giving you a dish that tastes as though it came straight out of a firelit camp on the coast.</p>

    <p>The marinade brings balance and contrast to the smokiness. Soy sauce lays the salty foundation, while sesame oil adds a nutty richness that clings to the fish. Fresh ginger and garlic bring their sharp aromatics, cutting through the richness of the salmon and keeping each bite lively. Rice vinegar adds just enough brightness to keep the flavors from feeling heavy, while the green onions round everything out with their fresh bite. It’s a recipe where every element has a purpose—nothing wasted, nothing overdone.</p>

    <p>The end result is tender salmon that flakes easily, layered with subtle smoke from the cedar and complexity from the marinade. Served directly from the plank, it makes a striking centerpiece, perfect for sharing at a gathering or savoring quietly on your own. Whether paired with simple rice, a crisp salad, or roasted vegetables, this dish is versatile, deeply flavorful, and built to impress without unnecessary complication </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 (12 inch) untreated cedar planks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce or coconut aminos</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped green onions</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic, fresh or jarred</li>
        <li>2 salmon fillets, skin removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the cedar planks in water for at least 1 hour before cooking. (Weigh them down with a plate to keep submerged.)</li>
        <li>Prepare the marinade: In a bowl, whisk together soy sauce, vegetable oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, green onions, ginger, and garlic.</li>
        <li>Marinate the salmon: Place salmon fillets in a shallow dish or resealable bag. Pour marinade over, turning to coat. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat grill or oven to medium heat (about 375°F / 190°C). If using a grill, set for indirect cooking.</li>
        <li>Arrange planks: Place soaked cedar planks on the grill or oven rack until they begin to smoke lightly.</li>
        <li>Cook salmon: Place marinated fillets directly on planks. Roast 15–20 minutes, until salmon flakes easily with a fork and reaches 145°F (63°C).</li>
