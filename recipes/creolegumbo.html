    <h1>New Orleans Creole Gumbo</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Creole gumbo is the soul of New Orleans cooking—a dish that carries history, community, and comfort in every spoonful. Built from a dark, smoky roux, gumbo develops its rich flavor slowly, with each step layering depth and character. The browned flour and oil base gives it body and warmth, while the “holy trinity” of onions, bell peppers, and celery lays down the aromatic heart.</p>

    <p>Andouille sausage infuses the pot with a smoky, spicy backbone, while okra adds its signature earthiness and natural thickness. Gulf shrimp bring sweetness from the sea, balancing the boldness of the sausage and the heat of Creole spices. Every ladle is thick with flavor—smoky, savory, a little spicy, and deeply satisfying.</p>

    <p>Served over fluffy white rice, gumbo is more than just a meal—it’s a gathering. It’s a dish that invites you to slow down, to stir often, to taste as you go, and to share the finished pot with friends or family. It’s hearty enough for cold evenings, celebratory enough for special occasions, and always best when made with patience and care.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour (for the roux)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound andouille sausage, sliced into rounds</li>
        <li>1 pound raw shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>2 cups okra, sliced</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>6 cups chicken stock (or seafood stock)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Creole seasoning (plus more to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Cooked white rice, for serving</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley and sliced green onions, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the roux: In a large heavy pot or Dutch oven, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Gradually whisk in flour, stirring constantly. Cook 15–20 minutes, until the roux turns a deep brown color—like chocolate. Be patient; don’t rush this step.</li>
        <li>Add aromatics: Stir in onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Brown the sausage: Add andouille slices and cook until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Build the gumbo: Stir in okra, diced tomatoes, stock, Creole seasoning, thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. Let cook gently for 45–60 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Finish with shrimp: Add shrimp in the last 5–7 minutes of cooking. Simmer until pink and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Taste and season: Adjust salt, pepper, and Creole seasoning to your preference.</li>
        <li>Serve: Spoon gumbo over warm white rice. Garnish with parsley and green onions. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
