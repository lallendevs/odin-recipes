    <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
    <img src="../images/crabsalad.png" alt="A bowl of fresh crab salad">
        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Light, cool, and refreshing, this summer crab salad celebrates the sweetness of fresh crab with crisp vegetables and a creamy, tangy dressing. It’s the kind of dish that doesn’t need to be fussy—simple ingredients come together quickly to create something that feels both indulgent and refreshing. Perfect for hot afternoons, cookouts, or an easy make-ahead lunch, it’s a dish that lets the crab shine without being weighed down.</p>

    <p>The dressing blends mayonnaise and cocktail sauce with lemon juice and garlic, striking a balance between creamy, tangy, and just a little zesty. Crisp pickles, juicy tomatoes, and sharp red onion cut through the richness, giving the salad crunch and brightness. Every bite combines sweet seafood with pops of acid and savory depth.</p>

    <p>Serve it spooned onto lettuce leaves, piled high on a toasted bun, or simply chilled in a bowl with a wedge of lemon on the side. However you enjoy it, this crab salad captures the flavor of summer in its simplest, most satisfying form.</p>
